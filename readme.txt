Included Files:

pub_crypto.py - This is the wsu-crypt program file
readme.Text - This is the readme file for this project
testfile.txt = this is the test file I used to test for files larger than 8 characters


Details:
Pub_crypto.py is a program that takes textfile and through modulation and an implementation of miller-rabin
creates a public key and a private key. The public key is used by the encryption method to create two integer
pairs refered to as C1 and C2. C1 and C2 are then used in combination with the private key that was generated.

The program was written in Python 3.5.2 so in order to run the program just simply in the location of the 
program type python pub_crypto.py and make sure that the text file you want to encrypt is in the same 
location. Upon running a menu will pop up in the terminal asking for key generation, encryption, and decryption.
Please run key generation first, then encryption, and then decryption. I have submitted the testfile I used 
to encrypt and decrypt that I highly recommend you use.
